# Graphic-Novel-Legends

Reasoning behind this project: 

I haven't touched frontend development in a couple of weeks, which is way too long.
This is the first React project I've ever done. I always told myself that I don't know enough skills to be able to even LEARN react (crazy, right),
but being my worst critic has done more harm than good to my ability to gain new skills. 
I will continue to make more react projects and add new technologies every month to my projects


Ok now since we are done with the rant, the rest of this is going to be footnotes about 
what I learned in this project.

Learned how to import and export other modules
Learned the importance of "props" and why developers rely on them. 
Learned ALOT about reusability and how to make use of sectioning code (makes debugging  and clean up very easy)
Learned how to listen to events, which is key in web development.
